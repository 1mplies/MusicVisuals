# Myco Music Visualizer

Name: Lukas Vaiciulaitis

Student Number: C21522836

Class Group: TU858/2

# Description

fairly simple visualizer inspired by old graphic equalizers with additional effects
and a somewhat... mushroomy influence from a mushroomy? song choice.

a journey of a mushroom growing and sporulating, setting the scene for a mushroom take-over of the screen.
maybe this is the music of the mushrooms themselves! no im not insane, mushrooms sing songs!

# Instructions

when the visualizer is running the spacebar can be used to pause/play the song & visuals, and the mouse can be used to progress or rewind the song by clicking on
the x-axis, a visual progress bar is visible at the bottom

much of the scaling is relative and the display size can be set in the 'Myco' class

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
